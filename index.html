        <article class="about-me">
            <p>During my time at Full Sail University, I worked with talented Animators, Modelers, and Riggers. I had the pleasure to work with other students on projects and them pointers that helped improve their projects.  After college, I signed up to work with one of my mentors as an Intern for six months creating new portfolio projects. But I found more joy in putting stunning looking websites together as a Front End Developer</p>
